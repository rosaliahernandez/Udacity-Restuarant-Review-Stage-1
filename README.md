## Udacity Restaurant Review Stage 1 

This project was built as part of the Udacity Front End Nanodegree. The goal of the project was to take an non-responsive website and transform it into a responsive web app that functions on any device regardless of screen size. Once that was completed the project would serve as a restaurant review site that included a map, filters, and customer reviews.
